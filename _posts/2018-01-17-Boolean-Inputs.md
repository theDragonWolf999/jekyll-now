    <td>I used all of my previous experience using logic gates, binary and coding to solve the problems the website gave me. Thinking in Boolean was hard but helped me solve the questions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I thought in numbers, which was fine for earlier questions but the complex questions required more lateral thinking.</td>

    <td>I will try to think more in Boolean, so I can get through the problems quicker.</td>
