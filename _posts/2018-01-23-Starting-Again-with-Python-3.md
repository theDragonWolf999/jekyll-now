  <tr>
    <td>I tried to test the new language by trying the code we already knew and seeing if it worked. Things such as Print have changed, which took some getting used to.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I went offtopic in my code, which limited the accuracy of my code to the worksheet. Whilst it expanded my learning in other topics, it strayed away from what I was set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to make my code simpler, so I can understand it better.</td>
