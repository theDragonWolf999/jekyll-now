    <td>I tried to test the different inputs by seeing how they could be converted and combined with each other. I also used conditional gates to improve my work.</td>

    <td>I went offtopic in my code, which limited the accuracy of my code to the worksheet. Whilst it expanded my learning in other topics, it strayed away from what I was set.</td>
