    <td>To work on for and while loops.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I tried to find ways to use for and while loops in an array of situations. I also tried to find which type of loop would be suitable for which circumstances.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I tried to use the while loop more, because I understood it better, however the for loop has more properties and can do many things that while would struggle with.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to implement my code in different ways to boost the amount of code I learn. I will try to use a combination of both types of loop.</td>
