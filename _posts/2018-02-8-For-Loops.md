    <td>I tried to find ways to use for loops in an array of situations. I also tried to find out how the for loop could simulate the while loop.</td>

    <td>I will try to implement my code in different ways to boost the amount of code I learn. I will try to use the challenge exercises to extend my learning.</td>
