    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We knew how to use a reasonable amount of Python 3.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson:</td>
    <td>To continue working on Codecademy.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I continued with my Codecademy work.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I tried to apply my work in Python 3, which helped when working with custom modules. I also used alternate solutions after completing the initial task to extend my working. I also tried to use the define function, as I needed more work in the define function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The code was different to what we used in Repl, which caused some confusion in how to use certain modules. I also struggled with functions that we had not used in a while, as I'd got much further on in Codecademy than we had as a class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to use more of my Python 3 code to see if it is compatible with Python 2. I will also see if the new abilities I have learnt in Codecademy work in Repl.it.</td>
  </tr>
