Our first IT lesson involved making a Caesar Cipher decoder/encoder in Google Sheets. This involved making an index where you looked up the letter and it retrieved the encoded version. As I already had experience with spreadsheets, I went on to write a more complex version that took a numerical input for the rotation and uses the Unicode identifiers. Near the end of the lesson, I experimented with a function to retrieve a random unicode character.

Spent most of my time formatting my blog, sorry if this is too short!

Just to see if text formatting travels to my blog:

**Bold ***italics *underline strikethrough subscript superscript

Does the following image load?
