After finishing the Caesar shift, I moved on to a side project.

L33TG3N is a little project used to convert words into leetspeak, where certain letters are expressed as numbers. It runs on the same sort of engine as the Caesar shift, breaking the word into separate letters and looking them up in an array. It lacks the polish of my Caesar shift however.
