This week, I attempted to make my coding spreadsheet a bit more complex and a bit more efficient, by nesting formulas and adding new features. The first thing added was a decryption and encryption system and a method so you can input a word and it will split it into individual characters. Sadly, for some reason, the spreadsheet would not decode the characters 'a' or ‘b’ and no teachers knew how to fix it. Next lesson, I need to try to implement Unicode or Ascii methods to bypass the glitch.

Now, let's see if RTL Override works here…

‮IF THIS WORKS THIS TEXT WILL BE BACKWARDS AND THE STUFF AFTER IT MAY BE INTERESTING!
