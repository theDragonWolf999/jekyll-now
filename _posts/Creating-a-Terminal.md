This lesson, I moved all the data and scripts to another sheet, leaving only simple input and output on one sheet. This allowed me to create a lot more advanced UI and form more aesthetically pleasing programs. I then went about making the code easier to add new features to, by laying out the data in a more readable way.

Next lesson, I will add new features!
