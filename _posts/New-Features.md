Now I have a basic runnable script, I can start to add features!

* Firstly, I added a daily shift function which generates a code from the current date. This can be enabled by a checkbox.

* Secondly, I added support for password shifts, which treats the word like a base-36 number and converts it into decimal. Any alphanumeric string can be used as long as it isn't too long, at which point it may break the mod function.

* Finally, I added some new indicators to make the interface more intuitive.
